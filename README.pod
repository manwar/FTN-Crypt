=head1 NAME

FTN::Crypt - Encryption of the FTN messages.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use FTN::Crypt;

    $cr = FTN::Crypt->new(
        Nodelist => 'nodelist/NODELIST.*',
    );
    
    $cr->encrypt_message(
        Address => $ftn_address,
        Message => $msg_raw,
    );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The possibility of FTN netmail encryption may be sometimes a useful option.
Corresponding nodelist flag was proposed in FSC-0073.

Although current FidoNet Policy (version 4.07 dated June 9, 1989) clearly
forbids routing of encrypted traffic without the express permission of
all the links in the delivery system, it's still possible to deliver such
messages directly. And, obviously, such routing may be allowed in FTN
networks other than FidoNet.

The proposed nodelist userflag is ENCRYPT:[TYPE], where [TYPE] is one of
'PGP2', 'PGP5', 'GnuPG'. So encryption-capable node should have something
like U,ENCRYPT:PGP5 in his nodelist record.
